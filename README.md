Project Overview
This Django project was developed during my one-month vacation between courses. I started this project with zero prior knowledge of Django and web development, aiming to learn and explore various aspects of Django and related technologies.

Project Details
In this project, I've covered a wide range of topics and learned the following:

Version Control with Git and GitHub: I have successfully utilized Git and GitHub to manage my project's source code and collaborate with others.

Django Basics: I've gained a solid understanding of fundamental Django concepts, including models, views, templates, and URL routing.

Database Queries: I've learned how to perform database queries using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, allowing me to interact with the database efficiently.

Forms: I've created forms to collect and validate user input, providing a seamless user experience.

Authentication: I've implemented Django's built-in authentication system to handle user registration, login, and account management.

Front-End Development: I've worked with HTML and a bit of CSS to create a visually appealing user interface for my project.

Bootstrap Framework: I've integrated the Bootstrap framework to enhance the project's front-end design and user experience, making it more responsive and visually appealing.

Image Handling: I've learned how to import and display images in my Django project, enhancing its visual appeal.

File Handling: I've implemented features to download PDF, CSV, and text files from the database, offering data export functionality.
